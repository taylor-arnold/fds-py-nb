The movie data has been split into several tables: `movie` contains basic information about each film (runtime, rating, etc.), `genre` lists the genres associated with each film, `color` contains information about the colors in each movie's poster, and `people` has information about the cast and crew. Because some movie titles are duplicated across different years, we will always join by both year and title to ensure we match records correctly."
