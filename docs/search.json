We can see that in the shape parameter printed out above the DataFrame.\nCan you figure out how the rows of the data are ordered?\nAnswer: Based on the first and last rows, it appears to be alphabetically by the food item name (starts with Apple and three other A’s, then Banana and Chickpea, ending with Yogurt).\nThroughout this book, we will want to apply data manipulation, visualization, and modeling functions to data. Whenever possible, which is most of the time, we will write these are method chains in a very specific format. The first line of a code block starts with an opening parenthesis and the final line has the closing parenthesis. Inside, each of the steps of the analysis will get placed with four leading spaces (you should be able to hit tab in Colab to get this), with one step on each line. The dataset goes on its own line.\nIn the code below, greate a method chain that starts with food (on its own line), applies the method .head(10) to grab the first ten rows, and the applies the method .tail(3) to grab the last three rows the remaining data. Hint: The code should have five total lines.\n\n(\n    food\n    .head(10)\n    .tail(3)\n)\n\n\nshape: (3, 16)\n\n\n\nitem\nfood_group\ncalories\ntotal_fat\nsat_fat\ncholesterol\nsodium\ncarbs\nfiber\nsugar\nprotein\niron\nvitamin_a\nvitamin_c\nwiki\ncolor\n\n\nstr\nstr\ni64\nf64\nf64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nstr\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\"Bell Pepper\"\n\"vegetable\"\n26\n0.0\n0.059\n0\n2\n6.03\n2.0\n4.2\n0.99\n2\n63\n317\n\"bell_pepper\"\n\"green\"\n\n\n\"Crab\"\n\"fish\"\n87\n1.0\n0.222\n78\n293\n0.04\n0.0\n0.0\n18.06\n4\n0\n5\n\"callinectes_sapidus\"\n\"red\"\n\n\n\"Broccoli\"\n\"vegetable\"\n34\n0.3\n0.039\n0\n33\n6.64\n2.6\n1.7\n2.82\n4\n12\n149\n\"broccoli\"\n\"green\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat rows, relatively to the original dataset, are returned by the sequence of steps above? Answer: We have the 8th, 9th, and 10th rows from the original dataset. This comes from first taking off the first 10 rows with head and then grabbing the last 3 rows of the result with tail.\nNote that method chains never modify the original dataset. After running the code above food still has all of the original data and the new version you printed out is no longer available. If we want to save a copy of the output, we need to add something like new_name = before the paranthesis on the first line of the code. When we do this, the original dataset will remain but we have a copy in the new_name object. In the code below, repeat the steps we did above with food but create a new object food_sub that consists of the subset of three rows.\n\nfood_sub = (\n    food\n    .head(10)\n    .tail(3)\n)\n\nNotice that we do not get to see the output of the operation above. Python does not print out the result because we saved it as a new variable. To see the result, we would need to write the name of the dataset as an extra row in the code block all on its own. This, for example, is how we printed the food dataset in the first question above. Do this below, recreating the food_sub and then including the name food_sub on its own line to see the data.\n\nfood_sub = (\n    food\n    .head(10)\n    .tail(3)\n)\nfood_sub\n\n\nshape: (3, 16)\n\n\n\nitem\nfood_group\ncalories\ntotal_fat\nsat_fat\ncholesterol\nsodium\ncarbs\nfiber\nsugar\nprotein\niron\nvitamin_a\nvitamin_c\nwiki\ncolor\n\n\nstr\nstr\ni64\nf64\nf64\ni64\ni64\nf64\nf64\nf64\nf64\ni64\ni64\ni64\nstr\nstr\n\n\n\n\n\"Bell Pepper\"\n\"vegetable\"\n26\n0.0\n0.059\n0\n2\n6.03\n2.0\n4.2\n0.99\n2\n63\n317\n\"bell_pepper\"\n\"green\"\n\n\n\"Crab\"\n\"fish\"\n87\n1.0\n0.222\n78\n293\n0.04\n0.0\n0.0\n18.06\n4\n0\n5\n\"callinectes_sapidus\"\n\"red\"\n\n\n\"Broccoli\"\n\"vegetable\"\n34\n0.3\n0.039\n0\n33\n6.64\n2.6\n1.7\n2.82\n4\n12\n149\n\"broccoli\"\n\"green\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these notebooks, please only save the output with a new object name if specifically instructed to do so.

    "text": "This is our first Python notebook! The idea is just to have something to show (hopefully) how easy it is to get up and running in Python using Colab. Anyone can open this file and see the code. In order to run it, you’ll need to be signed into a Google account.\n\nSetup\nEvery notebook will start with some setup code. Here, the first block downloads the class-specific helper functions, the second loads all of the Python modules we need, and the final one downloads the data that we are using in this notebook. We won’t actually be using the data this time, but I’ve included it here just to demonstrate the normal process.\nRun each of these cells in order by clicking on the triangular play button to the left when hoving on the cell. Wait for each to finish before continuing.\n\n! wget -q -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylor-arnold/fds-py/refs/heads/main/funs.py\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport polars as pl\n\nfrom funs import *\nfrom plotnine import *\nfrom polars import col as c\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n\nub = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taylor-arnold/fds-py-nb/refs/heads/main/\"\n\n\nfood = pl.read_csv(ub + \"data/food.csv\")\n\n\n\nQuestions\nMost notebooks will consist of blank blocks of code. There will be questions asking you to do certain things by writing code and then running it within each of the blocks. Sometimes, there will also be another question and corresponding Answer: tag after the code that asks you to provide a short textual response. You can type this directly after the tag. Let’s try this out! In the block below, use Python to compute the sum of two plus two.\n\n2 + 2\n\n4\n\n\nWhat is the sum?\nAnswer: Four, of course!\nAs in the notes, create a variable called my_fav_number equal to your favorite number. Note: See the font that the variable is in? Those come from putting the variable in back quotes within the text. Those are used to indicate that something in the prose text is a Python variable, function, or module. You will see that in the solutions these get printed in a code-font as well.\n\n# the solutions often show possible answers rather than\n# the only answer; also, there may be comments such as this\n# that start with the # symbol and provide additional \n# feedback on the answer\nmy_fav_number = 8  \n\nNow, use the function np.log, a function that comes from the numpy module to compute logarithms, to find the logarithm of 10.\n\nnp.log(10)\n\nnp.float64(2.302585092994046)\n\n\nIf you are less mathematically-oriented, you might be worried that we are starting with a lot of mathematics? Don’t be! This is only because it’s the easiest thing to do before we have learned any of the data-specific functions that will come up in the next chapter. If you are very mathematically-oriented, you may be worried about by why the logarithm of 10 is not 1. The reason for this is the Python, like most programming languages but unlike most mathematical texts, uses the term log to indicate the natural logarithm (i.e., base e).\n\n\nColab Setup\nWe have seen in the examples above that we can run Python code in Colab with no Colab-specific setup required. There are a few things that will be helpful to change in the default settings going forward. If you set these once from your Google account, they should persist without having the reset them each time. To start, click on Tools and Settings to open the settings box. Then:\n\nUnder Editor change “Indentation width in spaces” to 4.\nUnder Editor, unclick “Automatically close brackets…”\nUnder Editor, under “Code Diagnostics” select “None”\nUnder AI Assistance, click the “Hide generative AI features” and unclick everything else (very important!)\n\nThere are also two very important keyboard shortcuts to know:\n\nRun selected cell in place: Cmd + Enter (macOS), Ctrl + Enter (Windows)\nRun cell and move to next cell: Shift + Enter (macOS and Windows)\n\nA few other things are helpful to know about Colab. Under File, you can click on “Save a Copy in Drive”. This will save your work in a special Colab folder within your Google Drive. Otherwise, you will loss all of your work when closing the window.\nIf you reopen the Notebook from your Google Drive, it will use your default language settings, which may be difficult to use if it is not in English. You can change this by selecting Help (always the last item in the menu) and “Show in English” (always the last item in the pull-down menu).\nFinally, it seems that Google has been giving free Colab Pro accounts to students and educators. If you get a pop-up about this, it is worth going through the steps. While Colab is free, you’ll get more powerful options for running code with the Pro version, which could be useful (but not necessary) in the later chapters.",
